#### How it Works

The program will use a constructor to allow user to order a pizza with custom
toppings and calculate the price of this pizza using a prototype.

#### Specs:

+ The program takes a user input to add toppings to a pizza.
  - Example Input: *click*
  - Example Output: Adds topping to list.

+ The program accepts only specific pizza toppings via menu list.
  - Example Input: Olives
  - Example Output: Adds olives to list.

+ The program creates a  unique pizza with specific characteristics based on the input.
  - Example Input: ...Toppings, Crust.
  - Example Output: Pizza 1: Toppings, crust.

+ The program can calculate the price of the pizza based on its characteristics.
  - Example Input: Size, Toppings, Crust.
  - Example Output: $15.99

+ The program can show the user information about their order when requested.
  - Example Input: Show Order
  - Example Output: 14", Olives, Mushrooms, $15.99.

+ In the output, the program replaces any numbers divisible by 3 with the word "Ping".
  - Example Input: 4
  - Example Output: 4, Ping, 2, 1

+ In the output, the program replaces any numbers divisible by 5 with the word "Pong".
  - Example Input: 6

+ In the output, the program replaces any numbers divisible by 15 with the word "PingPong".
  - Example Input: 16

+ The program has input buttons that increase and return the font size on click.
  - Example Input: little 1
  - Example Output: big 1

+ The program has an "Insanity mode" button which toggles a class that adds really
  horrible styling to many elements, and a button to remove this class.
  - Example Input: click event
